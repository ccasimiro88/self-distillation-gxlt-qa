Critically, these performance differences correlate with distinct patterns in the $\alpha_{KL}^{mAP@10}$ coefficient evolution shown in Figure \ref{fig:curve-mAP@k-alphas-alpha_kl}. In the successful training case (blue curve), the coefficient gradually increases from ~0.6 to 1 by the training midpoint, with initial oscillations that eventually stabilize and decrease in amplitude, indicating an effective cross-lingual transfer. Conversely, the unsuccessful training case without CE (red curve) displays persistent oscillations around 0.5 throughout training with no improvement in stability or reduction in standard deviation, directly corresponding to the poorer cross-lingual performance observed in our ablation study.
